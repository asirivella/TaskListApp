Below are the advantages of Phabricator in code quality improvement:
- Every project is divided into different feature (tasks) and their sub-tasks. The phabricator associates the project progress with the sub-tasks and its git commits, enabling code changes to be associated with the tasks.
- With code review tool, every commit is shared to our fellow developers, with the help of fellow developer we could crack the code a bit earlier and together we can improve the solution.
- For the higher level management, phabricator helps as a tool to track and access the capabilities of a developer, which in terms helps in proper work-load management.
